# Quick Convert

version 0.1
These damn discord clips are too big!!

## Install

1. Clone this repo
2. Edit the .reg.template file to have the absolute paths to the script and icon, where necessary ("Icon"= and @=)
3. Rename the reg template to .reg
4. Double-click the new .reg file to install

## Caveats

* The icon filename can't have dashes (-), use underscores (_)
* Remember to escape special characters in the .reg file. So, `\\` for `\`, `\"` for quotes, etc.

## Improvements

* Make an installer that does all the annoying filepath changes n shid
* Add sub-commands for different compression settings (currently hardcoded)
* Add configuration gui
